# Echo

- A client communicates with an “echo” server
- The server simply echoes whatever it receives back to the client

In client-server socket programming, an echo server is a simple application that listens for incoming client connections, receives data, and sends the exact same data back to the client. This is often used as a basic example for learning socket programming.

i have created ECHO server for both [stream(TCP)](./message_passing/stream/Readme.md) and [datagram(UDP)](./message_passing/datagram/Readme.md)

i have also creared `unix i/o` click [here](./message_passing/unixIO/)

> all these are example of Message Passing communication. to see the examples of Shared Memory click [here](./shared_memory/)
